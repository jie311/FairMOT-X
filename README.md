# FairMOT-X

## Project Overview

FairMOT-X is a multi-class multi object tracker, which has been tailored for training on the BDD100K MOT Dataset. It makes use of YOLOX as the detector from end-to-end, and uses DCN to perform feature fusion of PAFPN outputs to learn the ReID branch. This repo is a work in progress.

## Acknowledgement
This project heavily uses code from the the original [FairMOT](https://github.com/ifzhang/FairMOT), as well as [MCMOT](https://github.com/CaptainEven/MCMOT) and [YOLOv4 MCMOT](https://github.com/CaptainEven/YOLOV4_MCMOT).
